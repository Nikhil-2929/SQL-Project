Customer-to-Customer (C2C) E-Commerce User Behavior Analysis (SQL Project)

This project analyzes user behavior on a Customer-to-Customer (C2C) e-commerce platform using SQL. The platform connects buyers and sellers, allowing individuals to conduct business transactions directly. By exploring the users_data dataset (98,913 rows, 27 columns), we aim to gain insights into user activity, transaction trends, and engagement levels.

Through SQL queries, we will:

✅ Identify buyer and seller distribution across different regions.

✅ Analyze top-selling countries and transaction success rates.

✅ Explore user engagement patterns to optimize business strategies.

✅ Detect trends and anomalies in user activity for business growth.

This analysis will help in understanding user interactions, improving platform efficiency, and making data-driven business decisions.
